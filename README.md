# 120-_Years_of_Olympic_games

READ ME

The following case study, I have analyzed data from 120 years of Olympic games.
I tried to proof/disproof the following hypotheses;

  -The most successful athlete is a male
    -A man will hold the most gold medals (count)
    -Most overall medals (count)

  -The US is the most successful nation
    -All-time medal leader in overall medals and gold medals (count)

  -The weight and height have increased for summer game athletes

  -China was the runner-up in the last four summer games (2004-2016)
    -China succeeds in less events than the most successful nation in this period
	  -But, these events are, in the majority, different to the most successful nation

  -There is a negative correlation between age and medals won
  	
	-This was attempted through calculating the correlation between these two variables

  -In 2016, women and men had an equal number of participants

To perform this analysis, I have used Jupyter Notebook, where I have not just used Python
but also imported the SQL logic to analyze the data.

Have a look at my (unexpected) results and let me know what you think :)
